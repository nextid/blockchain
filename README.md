# NextCert BlockChain Plugins
This is an open source library for plugins to support different blockchains. Currently we support Ethereum, Zilliqa and Tezos, for both issuance and verification.  We recommend Tezos, which reduces the transaction cost while providing users a more environmentally sustainable business model.
